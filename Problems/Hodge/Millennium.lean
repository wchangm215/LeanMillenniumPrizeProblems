# The Hodge Conjecture

Lean statement of the Clay Millennium problem “Hodge conjecture”.

**Warning (September 2026 review).**  This file is an axiomatic *sketch*, not a faithful formal
statement of the Hodge conjecture, and `MillenniumHodge.ClayHodge` is **not a valid prize
target**.  Two independent defects are machine-checked in `Tests/Hodge/`:

* every `SmoothProjectiveVariety ℂ` has no complex points at all, because `points` is required to
  be in bijection with the plain `Scheme` hom-set `Spec ℂ ⟶ X` (which has more than continuum many
  elements whenever it is nonempty) and to inject into a finite `ℙ^N(ℂ)`; hence `ClayHodge` is
  vacuously true (Kevin Buzzard, PR #9; `Tests/Hodge/StatementIsVacuous.lean`);
* `hodge_subspace` and `cycle_class` are free data: replacing the cycle-class map by `0` preserves
  every "canonical" anchor, so `ClayHodge` forces all even-degree rational cohomology to vanish and
  would become false as soon as the first defect were repaired
  (`Tests/Hodge/CycleClassUnconstrained.lean`).

A faithful statement needs the analytic topology on `X(ℂ)`, singular cohomology with a *defined*
Hodge decomposition, a *defined* cycle-class map, and the comparison isomorphism between rational
and complex cohomology, none of which exist in Mathlib yet.  Until then the registry records the
problem as `statement_incomplete` and there is no `sorry` placeholder for it.

For a projective nonsingular algebraic variety `X` over `ℂ`, every rational `(p,p)` Hodge class in
`H^{2p}(X, ℚ)` should be a finite `ℚ`-linear combination of cohomology classes of algebraic cycles.

The definitions below use `HodgeData` from `Problems.Hodge.Variety`: cohomology groups, Hodge
summands, the Hodge filtration, algebraic cycles, and the cycle-class map.

`HodgeTheoryAssignment.ClayStatement` is stated for a coherent `HodgeTheoryAssignment`, which packages the
Hodge-theoretic realization attached to every smooth projective complex variety.

/--
A Hodge-theory realization intended to represent the canonical topology and Hodge decomposition
attached to smooth projective complex varieties.

Unlike a bare `HodgeTheoryAssignment`, a realization must record injectivity of rational
complexification and that the Hodge summands span complex cohomology in every degree. This keeps
the public Clay target from ranging over every arbitrary coherent test package in `Variety.lean`.
The interface can be replaced by native singular-cohomology constructions when Mathlib provides
them without changing the cycle-span statement.

  /-- The varietywise cohomology, Hodge, and cycle-class assignment. -/

/--
The native anchors required before an abstract realization may stand for the canonical Hodge
theory of a variety.

This condition rules out treating arbitrary synthetic `HodgeData` as geometry.  Rational and
complex cohomology must be linearly equivalent to Betti cohomology built from Mathlib's singular
homology of the complex points, while the indexed algebraic cycles must be actual closed
subschemes (ideal-sheaf data) of the underlying scheme, with the indicated codimension.

The equivalences are wrapped in `Nonempty` because only their existence matters to the statement;
no arbitrary choice of coordinates becomes part of the public target.

## Interface examples

The following examples show that the `HodgeData` interface has nonempty synthetic models where the
cycle-class and filtration machinery can be checked directly.  They are deliberately not used as
witnesses for `HodgeTheoryAssignment.ClayStatement`: the Clay statement above is about the coherent
Hodge-theoretic realization attached to smooth projective complex varieties.

## No placeholder theorem

Earlier versions of this file ended with `theorem clay_prize_hodge_conjecture : ClayHodge := by
sorry`.  It has been removed: `ClayHodge` is provable outright because no
`SmoothProjectiveVariety ℂ` has a point (see the warning at the top of this file and PR #9), so
the placeholder could be "solved" without any Hodge theory.  The registry records the problem as
`statement_incomplete`.
