## Hodge-theoretic definitions

The definitions below isolate the geometric input, cohomology groups, Hodge summands, and
cycle-class maps needed for the Hodge conjecture.

**Warning (September 2026 review).**  This file is an axiomatic *sketch*, not a faithful formal
statement of the Hodge conjecture, and `MillenniumHodge.ClayHodge` is **not a valid prize
target**.  Two independent defects are machine-checked in `Tests/Hodge/`:

* every `SmoothProjectiveVariety ℂ` has no complex points at all, because `points` is required to
  be in bijection with the plain `Scheme` hom-set `Spec ℂ ⟶ X` (which has more than continuum many
  elements whenever it is nonempty) and to inject into a finite `ℙ^N(ℂ)`; hence `ClayHodge` is
  vacuously true (Kevin Buzzard, PR #9; `Tests/Hodge/StatementIsVacuous.lean`);
* `hodge_subspace` and `cycle_class` are free data: replacing the cycle-class map by `0` preserves
  every "canonical" anchor, so `ClayHodge` forces all even-degree rational cohomology to vanish and
  would become false as soon as the first defect were repaired
  (`Tests/Hodge/CycleClassUnconstrained.lean`).

A faithful statement needs the analytic topology on `X(ℂ)`, singular cohomology with a *defined*
Hodge decomposition, a *defined* cycle-class map, and the comparison isomorphism between rational
and complex cohomology, none of which exist in Mathlib yet.  Until then the registry records the
problem as `statement_incomplete` and there is no `sorry` placeholder for it.

The Clay PDF uses Hodge theory of smooth projective complex varieties.  This file represents that
theory by an explicit interface: rational and complex cohomology, Hodge summands, filtration,
algebraic cycles, closed analytic subspaces, Chow comparison, and cycle classes.

## Native anchors for canonical Hodge theory

The abstract `HodgeData` interface below is useful for developing equivalent formulations, but an
arbitrary inhabitant must not be confused with the Hodge theory of a variety.  These definitions
provide the native objects to which a canonical realization is required to be anchored: Betti
cohomology is the linear dual of Mathlib's singular homology, and algebraic-cycle representatives
are closed subschemes encoded by ideal-sheaf data on the underlying scheme.

## Synthetic Hodge-data examples

The following constructions are **not** the Clay Hodge theory of a smooth projective variety.
They are small internal examples used to test the `HodgeData` interface: the cycle-class map,
filtration agreement, Chow comparison, and algebraic-span lemmas should behave correctly in
degenerate and finite-dimensional examples.

The public Hodge Millennium statement in `Problems.Hodge.Millennium` quantifies over canonical
`HodgeTheoryRealization` packages, not over every coherent assignment below. The models in this
section are consistency checks for the lower-level interface and do not automatically become
witnesses for the Millennium problem.

### One-dimensional model

The following Hodge data has `H^n(X,ℚ) = ℚ` and `H^n(X,ℂ) = ℂ` in every degree, scalar extension
given by the canonical map `ℚ → ℂ`, and one algebraic cycle for every rational class in degree
`2p`.  Its Hodge summands are `⊤` exactly in the matching degree `p+q=n` and `⊥` otherwise.

### Zero model

The following one-point cohomology theory is a concrete model of the definitions above.  All
cohomology groups are the zero module, all Hodge summands are the whole zero module, and the single
cycle class is zero.  The Hodge conjecture is then provable directly from the definitions.

This is another interface example, not the geometric Hodge theory appearing in the Clay
